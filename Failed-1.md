# Decompositions Playground (with binary trees)

We want to decompose a number is a way to represent it as a sum of smaller "standard" numbers. Let imagine we have a number $n$ where $n$ âˆˆ (0, 10] and we want to decompose it in a way that the sum of the decompositions is equal to $n$.

Also, only the following "standard" numbers are allowed: `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10`. All these numbers can be expressed as a sum of smaller numbers. Lets enumerate them all:

	 1 = { {  1 } }
	 2 = { {  2 }, { 1, 1 } }
	 3 = { {  3 }, { 2, 1 }, { 1, 1, 1 } }
	 4 = { {  4 }, { 3, 1 }, { 2, 2 }, { 2, 1, 1 }, { 1, 1, 1, 1 } }
	 5 = { {  5 }, { 4, 1 }, { 3, 2 }, { 3, 1, 1 }, { 3, 3 }, { 3, 2, 1 }, ....  }
	 8 = { {  8 }, { 6, 2 }, { 6, 1, 1 }, { 5, 2, 1 }, { 5, 1, 1, 1 }, .... }
	 9 = { {  9 }, { 8, 1 }, { 6, 3 }, { 6, 2, 1 }, .... }
	10 = { { 10 }, { 9, 1 }, { 8, 2 }, { 8, 1, 1 }, .... }

Just by looking at those trivial decompositions we can see that any number can be decomposed recursively in the sum of **two** smaller number. For example, the number `3` has only two smaller number `2` and `1` that it can be decomposed on (`3 = 2 + 1`). But at the same time `2` can also be decomposed has `1 + 1`.

![Graphical view](graph.png?raw=true "Tree of decompositions")

Each node of this tree contains a value and a list of the possible alternatives, which are represented as a typical binary tree node with a left and right branch.

## Generation without repetition (matrix)

Once we have the decomposition tree we can implement an algorithm that walks the tree in a way that generates the decompositions without duplications. By a duplication we mean $\{2, 1\}$ and $\{1, 2\}$ contains the exact same elements and only vary in the order of them so, they are equivalent and shouldn't repeat.


## Decomposition matrix

The idea is to decompose a number as the sum of at most $k$ smaller "standard" numbers. See the following matrix for an example of decomposition of number $7$ with $k = 5$

```
{ 6, 1, 0, 0, 0 }
{ 5, 2, 0, 0, 0 }
{ 5, 1, 1, 0, 0 }
{ 4, 3, 0, 0, 0 }
{ 4, 2, 1, 0, 0 }
{ 4, 1, 1, 1, 0 }
{ 3, 3, 1, 0, 0 }
{ 3, 2, 2, 0, 0 }
{ 3, 2, 1, 1, 0 }
{ 3, 1, 1, 1, 1 }
{ 2, 2, 2, 1, 0 }
{ 2, 2, 1, 1, 1 }
```

>Note tha the trick for avoiding duplications is by making sure the elements of the decomposition are sorted.

The construction of this matrix can be seeing more clearly if we put each decomposition and its alternatives in a same row as follow:

```
{ { 6, 1 }  }
{ { 5, 2 }, { 5, 1, 1 }  }
{ { 4, 3 }, { 4, 2, 1 }, { 4, 1, 1, 1 }  }
{ {  ,   }, { 3, 3, 1 }, { 3, 2, 2, 0 }, { 3, 2, 1, 1 }, { 3, 1, 1, 1, 1 } }
{ {  ,   }, {  ,  ,   }, {  ,  ,  ,   }, { 2, 2, 2, 1 }, { 2, 2, 1, 1, 1 } }
```

> Note that duplications decompositions are not shown but they are processed anyway.

```
    Expand(node: DecompositionTree, level: int):
        print (node.Value)
        foreach alt in node.Alternatives:
            if alt.Left.Value >= alt.Right.Value:
                print (alt)
            print (alt.Left.Value)
            Expand (alt.Right, level + 1)
            Expand (alt.Left, level + 1)
```

And the expected outputs is:

```
9
    8 + 1
    7 + 2
        1 + 1
    6 + 3
        2 + 1
    5 + 4
        3 + 1
        2 + 2
            1 + 1
```

```
{ 9 }
{ 8, 1 }
{ 6, 3 }
{ 6, 2, 1 }
{ 6, 1, 1, 1 }

{ 5, 4 }
{ 5, 3, 1 }
{ 5, 2, 2 }
{ 5, 2, 1, 1 }

{ 4, 4, 1 }
{ 4, 3, 2 }
{ 3, 3, 3 }
{ 4, 3, 1, 1 }
{ 4, 2, 2, 1 }
{ 3, 3, 2, 1 }
{ 3, 2, 2, 2 }
```
